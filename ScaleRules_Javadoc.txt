/**
	 * This method is used to define criteria for a response template that
	 * determines whether or not this question can be asked during the conversation.
	 * 
	 * The default is for this function to return 1, which indicates that the
	 * question may be asked at any time during the conversation. 
	 * 
	 * More specific rules should be defined during the ResponseTemplate instantiation. 
	 * 
	 * @return The integer output for this function will be multiplied to the relevancy
	 * ranking of the response template. This means that a value of 0 will force the 
	 * question to not be asked. A value of 1 will allow the question. Other values
	 * are allowed, but should be used with care, as they will affect the ordering of
	 * the questions asked.
